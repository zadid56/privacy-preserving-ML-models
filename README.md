# privacy-preserving-ML-models

A deep-learning model for false information / anomaly / intrusion detection in in-vehicle networks.

# project goal
1)	Create false information attack dataset from existing CAN bus datasets
2) Develop an LSTM encoder based classifier for false information attack detection in real-time
3) Compare with other existing anomaly detection classifiers such as KNN, SVM, RF, Naive Bayes, XGBoost and NN.
